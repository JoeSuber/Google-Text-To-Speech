Stop Stalin License:

This "Stop Stalin" License is meant to both encourage open-source style
community development AND leave the door open for people to make a buck
or two if they just invented the Double Cheeseburger of Software. I couldn't
find an existing license that did that and it was 'Stall'-'in' me in indecision.
And though I agree with much of the reasoning Stallman & co give I am tired
of the knee-jerk lefty-ness of it all. Richard Stalin gives the same speech
over and over... Look, we all know corporations want to make money. The real
goal should be to make them help you by creating and improving things as we go.
There is no political solution unless you are willing to liquidate the
kulacks Richard. Please forgive the bourgeois sensibility here:

-- BEGIN LICENSE --
An author is defined as a human individual possessing person-hood who
makes rightful claim to some measurable, significant, positive impact on the
creation of the specific purposeful functionality and / or documentation
of the work a.k.a. software and associated documentation. An author
must also desire to be identified as such.

By including this document as a file within a particular project folder,
and naming said file, "LICENSE" an author has expressed intention
to describe the author's copyright relationship to the included files,
perhaps forgoing rights otherwise reserved to author's of similar
works. In said group of files, this "LICENSE" pertains only to those
files that are to some extent, more or less, the author's rightful creative
work to dispose of in ways determined by custom and law.
 
By virtue of above the author is saying:

"As author of this work,
I license individuals to use this body of work, in whole or in part, for
personal enjoyment and education without demand of compensation,
with the non-exclusive proviso that this written license be reproduced
with all copies and derivative versions of this work along with reasonably
complete attributions of authorship in the source-work."
"Attributed authors shall have the rights and benefits of authorship
proportional to a reasonable interpretation of their contributions to
the working body of code & useful documentation that has been
developed under this license. This contribution is not for all time
and must be relevant to a state-of-the-art but properly functioning
version of the work. The exact method of measuring a given
contribution is beyond the scope of this license. It is best that
multiple authors agree on this method before any agreements
for commercial use of the given work are concluded."

"Modification of code and documentation by any individual is
encouraged, with the proviso that attribution to the original authors,
in good faith and so far as it is reasonable to ascertain, be accurately
preserved. Only an author has the right to create new versions or
"branches" of this work that are not subject to the full text of
this license ('LICENSE' in its entirety) and then only by removal of
complete sentences in the SPECIAL provision given below."

"SPECIAL provision:
An author reserves the right to charge non-authors who use or intend to
use this software in a commercial enterprise a reasonable fee to be
negotiated on a case-by-case basis. An author may protect the source
code from further modification as part of a commercial operating
environment by providing only executable code or obfuscating
the source-code provided. No authors may grant corporate or
incorporated entities, public or private the rights accorded to authors.
All claims of authorship must remain with individuals who are human
and may claim person-hood."

"Only the preceding SPECIAL provision may be abridged or redacted
as part of a mutual agreement for commercial-use between the
author and another individual, and then only with the proviso that
such an agreement apply to a separate and new "commercial branch"
of this software, which still must reproduce this license (minus desired
deletions from only the above paragraph) and full attributions in a way
that reasonable persons familiar with development of similar works
can understand & verify. Any part of the "commercial branch"
license shall be invalid if when properly construed, it changes the rights
granted to non-commercial users or any significant authors of
non-commercial trunks or parent-branches without their individually
expressed & recorded permission and consent."

"Authors who create 'commercial branch' licensed versions should make
good-faith efforts to contact authors whose stake of authorship entitles
them to compensation as part any concluded commercial license agreement.
All authors should understand that such efforts are undertaken at some
cost and justly compensate those who perform such labor from the total
remuneration the authors in total are to receive. If it is judged that
author-stakes below a certain threshhold cannot justify the effort of
contact and/or funds distribution, those funds may be held in trust
by agreed-upon parties until such time as authors come forward to claim 
their rightful portion minus administrative overheads."

"Gross examples of changing code or documentation simply to increase
the significance of authorship that one enjoys shall be interpreted as
forfeiture of authorship rights that would otherwise accrue to the
offending party. All judgements on such matters should be informed
by an understanding of the purpose or function that the work performs.
Arbiters of these disputes should understand the history of a work
as well as current usage examples"
